      "bn": "‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ"
    },
    "description": {
      "en": "English description",
      "hi": "‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§∞‡§£",
      "bn": "‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶£‡¶®‡¶æ"
    },
    "ingredients": ["ingredient 1", "ingredient 2"],
    "steps": [
      {
        "instruction": {
          "en": "English instruction",
          "hi": "‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§∂",

        },
        "duration": 300,
        "heat": "medium"
      }

\`\`\`

### Customizing Recommendations

Edit `data/recommendation_map.json` to modify mood/health combinations and their corresponding recipe suggestions.

## Development

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Make changes and see them reflected immediately

### Deployment Options

#### Streamlit Cloud
